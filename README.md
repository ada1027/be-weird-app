Be Weird is a whimsy, fun wellness app designed to break the monotony of student life through tiny, joyful acts of "cringe" or weirdness.
Each day, users receive 3–5 quirky, positive-energy side quests (from celebrating random “holidays” with cake to getting off the bus at a new stop)
Quests are divided into easy, medium, and hard, and users complete them by snapping a quick photo and uploading for their friends to see.
Features include:
- Daily Weird Quests (easy/medium/hard)
- Custom Personal Tasks
- Calendar Photo Log to revisit history of side quests
- Friends Feed that mimics a social media scroll, with likes and comments
-  Completion Rewards to encourage consistency

In the works:
- growing a character of choice as you do more side quests
- upvote or downvote someone's photo in relevance to their side quest
